# Video-Game-Market Analysis
## Overview
We conducted an analysis of market potential of 3 video games using Factor Analysis, Clustering, Gabor Granger Plots and Simulation 

## Problem Statement
Athena Softworks, Inc. is a video game developer and publisher.  They specialize in premium role playing games (RPGs) for PC play.  It is early 2020 and Athena is considering acquiring a new game title and there are three candidate games- Warrior Guild, Seraph Guardians and Evercrest. We have to determine the right game, price and positioning for Athena. 

## Methods
1. Factor Analysis: Conducted Factor Analysis to compress the reponse of survey participants for 40 statements into 9 factors that explained 70% of the variance. 

2. Clustering: Created 3 clusters based on their factor scores to understand the segments prevalent in the market. 

3. Demogrphic Analysis: Coducted Cross-tabulation with chi-square and Regression to understand the relationship between dempographic attributes and clusters. 

4. Gabor Granger: Developed Gabor Granger plots for willingness to pay and predicted revenue to determine the optimal price.

5. Simulation: Conducted Simulation to gauge the market potential of different games with varying prices, price sensitivity and probabilities for games based on ranking. 

## Recommendations
We recommend Athena to acquire Seraph Guardians because it has gained high preference from a significantly higher number of customers (check Jupyter notebook). In fact, it is expected to capture the highest market share of 25.18% even when variable pricing and multiple game purchase for one gamer is simulated.
